# Product App - MVVM, Clean Architecture, Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates a product application built using modern Android development practices, including:

*   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** A robust architectural pattern for separating concerns and improving testability.

*   **Clean Architecture:**  Ensuring a modular, maintainable, and testable codebase with clear separation of layers.

*   **Jetpack Compose:**  A modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android UIs.

## Overview

The application showcases a product catalog, allowing users to browse, view details, and potentially manage products. It serves as a practical example of how to structure an Android application with a focus on architecture and modern UI development.

## Key Technologies

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.

*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building the user interface.

*   **MVVM Architecture:**  Structuring the app for testability and maintainability.

*   **Clean Architecture Principles:**  Separation of concerns and dependency inversion.

*   **Coroutines and Flow:** For asynchronous operations and data streaming.

*   **Dependency Injection (e.g., Hilt):**  Managing dependencies effectively (if used in the project).

*   **Retrofit (likely):** For networking and API communication (if the app fetches data from a remote source).

## Architecture

The app follows a layered architecture based on Clean Architecture principles:

1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):**  Built with Jetpack Compose, containing composables, ViewModels, and UI-related logic.
2.  **Domain Layer:** Contains use cases or interactors, representing the business logic of the application.
3.  **Data Layer:** Responsible for data retrieval from various sources (e.g., local database, remote API).
4.  **Repository Layer:**  Acts as an abstraction between the Domain and Data layers, providing a clean API for data access.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```

    ```
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.
